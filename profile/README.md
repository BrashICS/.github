# BrashICS

Welcome! This README might never get updated, but hopefully I get around to it _one day_. The goal with creating this org was to attempt to shift away from [Replit](https://replit.com) and use some more industry-standard tools.

If you are a student and need to contact me, come see me in my classroom. In the even you are unable to see my in person, you can email me.
